    <p> In this website you can get information about me myself. As above mention I have passed my SEE from Mount View English Boarding School. Then I joined in Ace Higher Secondary 
        School for my higher studies. From their I obtained A grade. After that I decided to go United States Of America for my higher studies. So I applied in Harvard university. 
        And gladely I got accepted by obtaining  full Scholarship. After getting acceptance letter i took the date for visa interview. I got the date of august 10 2022. I was extremely
        nervous and scared. But my friends motivated and chereed me up through that my confidence boost up and i cracked the interview they were very much satisfied with my answer.
        After all this process I got a visa acceptance letter from US embassy. My session was starting from december so I have to arrive USA till first of October. Then i went to University
        and started my course of CSIT. I completed the course in 4 years with A very good grade. Then after graduating I started Apple company with my friends in a small garrage.
        We were all total 4 members. We were very keen in Website Developement. So we build our own website and started doing drop shipping. We use the ship the goods from one dealer to customer
        globally. AT first it was pretty much harsh we couldnot get any customer and we were totally depressed. But after 6 months we get our first customer. Then after that it was rocket
        boomed customer were coming in a huge number. And after that in 2 years our company was worth 10 million US dollar. We were all fulfilling our dreams such as buying luxury cars, house, bikes etc.
